Popular Movies
==============

Popular Movies is an app that is able to pull data from TheMovieDB and is
created as part of the Udacity Android Nanodegree program. It is able to pull
data provided it has an API key, which must be located in the
com.example.judge.popularmovies.api.TmdbApiKey file under the KEY string
constant. This is not included due to the private nature of the key.
